you're going to create a nested route for users and pets 

resources :users do 
  resources :pets 
  end 


  under the user showpage you're going to have a button that says "create pet"

  it will then take you to a route that looks like this " /users/:user_id/pets/new"

  This route will be a form. It's only purpose is to create a new pet 

  once it creates a pet take it to the  pet index? or caretaker index or event index? which ever you prefer. 

 
<%= form_for @pet do |f| %>
    <%= f.collection_select :pet_id, Pet.all, :id, :name %>
    <%= f.submit %>
  <% end %>
